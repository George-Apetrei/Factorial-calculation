# Factorial-calculation
A program to calculate any factorial
Written in C++

Input any number maximum size of int and it will output the factorial on the console and also in "data.txt" which it creates in the same folder that it's run.

Note: Calculations for big numbers might take a long time to complete, the maximum size of the end result is the maximum size of vectors.

It is faster to use a lookup table for big numbers than to calculate them.
